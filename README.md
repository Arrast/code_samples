# 📂 Code Samples Repository
<h3>Welcome to my Repository!
I will try to upload here some small tools, or code samples that I've made that I think could be useful (Or that I'm proud of, at least).
I hope you like them! (And like always, feedback is always welcome!)</h3>

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
Hi! I am Victor Manuel Egea Rodriguez!
I've been a Game Developer for over 10 years, focusing mostly in Unity and C#.

## 🧾 Contents
Each directory in this repository represents a standalone code sample or small tool. I'll keep this updated to show some small details about it.
