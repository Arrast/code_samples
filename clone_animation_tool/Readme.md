This is the Animation Clone tool that I created for my small 2D platformer project.

I developed this tool because I realized that a lot of the animations for the enemies, the weapons, etc... were basically just Sprite swaps, keeping the same Animator states and everything.

I decided to use AnimatorOverrideControllers for this because I thought it would be easier than actually cloning the AnimatorController.

Here's a small video showing the functionality (The UI has changed a bit after, but it still works the same).
